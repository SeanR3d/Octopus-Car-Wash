Date: ~Fall 2016


This program uses a queue of linked list items to simulate a car wash.
The program will prompt the user for info about how the car wash runs, then it will
create a 'carWash.txt' file with results of how the car wash functioned during the durration that it was open.
The duration that the car wash is open is modifiable in main() under 'timeOpen'.
